## Special Directions
Once you have arrived at Dolphins Resort, follow the path to the Discovery Lodge. Take a moment to enjoy the gorgeous view of Discovery Passage.

## Dress Code
It’s time to dust off that suit or whip out that cocktail dress you’ve been dying to wear. We can’t wait to see you cut a rug in all your splendor. If weather permits, our ceremony may take place outside, but it’s March, so remember to bring a good coat, even if the sun shines in our favour.
