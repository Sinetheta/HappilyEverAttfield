Get a little closer to nature and go whale watching or spend a little time
soaking up true west-coast living by taking to the trails.
Here are some of our favourite jaunts:

### Millennium Trail

**Difficulty:** Strenuous<br>
**Distance/Time:** 2.4 kilometres – 1.5 hours return<br>
**Condition:** Good<br>
**Access:** From the South at the BC Hydro Station on the Canyon View Trail, from the West from Elk Falls Park at the falls parking lot.

This trail can be accessed from the Elk Falls viewpoint day-use parking lot and connects the Elk Falls Trails and the Canyon View Trail. This trail parallels the Campbell River along the canyon route, offering excellent views of the waterfall and the mature forest, containing some old-growth Douglas fir. This trail links with the Canyon View Trail just upstream from the John Hart Hydro Station at the junction of the Canyon View pedestrian bridge.

### Canyon View Trail:

**Difficulty:** Moderate, some uphill<br>
**Distance/Time:** 6 kilometres – 1 hour circle route<br>
**Condition:** There have been some landslides on the trail, caution is to be exercised.<br>
**Access:** Access for the Canyon View Trail is best at the BC Hydroregeneration station 3 km North of the Tamarac Street intersection on Highway 28 and Highway 19 and 19A.  Parking is ample and views of the river from this vantage point are stunning.

The Canyon View Trail is a scenic 6 km circular hike through WestCoast forest along the Campbell River. The route makes a good family outing and takes about one and a half hours to complete. BC Hydro’s trailhead is located at the John Hart Generating Station off Highway 28. The west end of the trail crosses the canyon on an 80-foot walkway which camouflages the natural gas pipeline running beneath it. At the east end of the trial, hikers cross the Campbell River using Timber West’s logging bridge and the Quinsam River using the Ministry of Transportation and Highways Bridge. Hikers should use extreme caution when crossing the Quinsam and Campbell River bridges, as vehicular traffic may be present.
