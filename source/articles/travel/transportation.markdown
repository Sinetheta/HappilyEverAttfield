On the evening of our wedding reception, March 26th,
the Campbell River Kinsman shuttle will be available to transport
any off-site guests to and from anywhere in town.

The drivers of the Campbell River Kinsman shuttle volunteer their time
and all funds ($5-$10/person donation recommended) raised from the evening
are donated to the Kinsman for Kids program, which concentrates on helping
children impacted by family violence or abuse.

Or, for cab services around Campbell River and to the airport use:
